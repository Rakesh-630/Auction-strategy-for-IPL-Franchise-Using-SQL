# Auction-strategy-for-IPL-Franchise-Using-SQL
Develop an effective IPL auction strategy using SQL by analyzing historical data to create a balanced squad. Organize data into tables like `Players`, `Performance`, `Auction`, and `Teams`. Identify player categories (e.g., batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders) using SQL queries and evaluate key metrics like strike rate, economy, and consistency. Analyze team composition trends, past auction dynamics, and player value-for-money ratios. Query top performers in different roles and prioritize uncapped talents or value players to optimize the budget. Use SQL joins and aggregations to ensure a strong mix of experience, youth, and role balance for the franchise.
